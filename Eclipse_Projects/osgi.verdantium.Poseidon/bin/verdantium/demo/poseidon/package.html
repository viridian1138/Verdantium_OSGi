<H1>Poseidon</H1>
<BR>
<P>Poseidon is a component that simulates how waves interact in a 
ripple tank.  High School science courses often use ripple tanks 
(shallow rectangular glass tanks filled with water) as a means to 
demonstrate how waves travel in a medium.  Ripple tanks can also be a 
pain in the neck from a practical standpoint.  They require careful 
handling, which they often don't get from students.  So Poseidon was 
written to provide a digital simulation of some ripple tank 
interactions.  By today's standards, it isn't a very good simulation.  
However, it does demonstrate some useful concepts.  Its source code 
also shows how to create a simple, no-frills component that does 
something useful.
