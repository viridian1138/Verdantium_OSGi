<BR>
<P>Verdantium (also known as the "embedding kit") is an advanced
framework for 2-D document embedding using software components.
Verdantium is configurable and component-independent.
Components can be added to Verdantium without performing a re-compile
on Verdantium (much like Photoshop plugins can be added to Photoshop).
The components are dynamically linked to Verdantium at runtime.
<BR>
<P>Verdantium has four major pillars: Objects, Persistence,
Embedding, and Scripting.  These were also the original four
pillars of OpenDoc, but Verdantium builds the pillars differently.
For instance in OpenDoc the object pillar is implemented by IBM's
System Object Model (SOM), while in Verdantium the object pillar
is implemented by the Java object model.  Java inherently has
many (if not all) of the capabilities of a system object model.
<BR>
<P>The object pillar is the only one implemented entirely by
the JDK itself.  The Verdantium code base rounds out the other
three pillars.  The persistence and embedding pillars draw
a significant amount of implementation support from Java Beans 
and Java JFC/Swing respectively.  The scripting pillar, on the
other hand, is written almost entirely from scratch.  The
use of existing APIs from Java Beans and Java JFC/Swing
significantly shortens the Verdantium code base, and makes
Verdantium more familiar to existing Java programmers.
<BR>
<P>Verdantium uses a number of concepts from OpenDoc, but
is not a port of OpenDoc to Java.  For instance, it does not
attempt to implement a rendering layer that will make JFC/Swing
emulate OpenDoc ODF.  Instead, components would have to be
converted from ODF to Swing.  Verdantium is an inherently 
Swing-oriented system.
<BR>
<P>Like certain other recently developed frameworks (particularly
Metrowerks Powerplant) Verdantium uses a number of mix-in concepts.
In Java, most mix-in functionality is implemented through
interfaces.  For an introduction to mix-ins, see the article
"The Power of Inheritance", Allen Hollub, BYTE Magazine, May 1993,
pp. 221-226.  Note that by the description given by the author of
this magazine article, Verdantium is somewhere between a "C++" and 
a "Smalltalk" paradigm.
<BR>
<P>A full description of Verdantium is beyond the scope of this
descriptive summary.  A document is currently being drafted to
fully describe this architecture.
