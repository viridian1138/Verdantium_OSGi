<BR>
<P>The vhelp (which stands for Verdantium Help) package provides
help functionality that can be used by any Verdantium component.
A Verdantium component is NOT required to use this help package.
In fact, a component can implement the "displayVerdantiumHelp" method 
with ANY code that its author finds appropriate.  However, vhelp
does provide a convenient default help implementation.
<BR>
<P>The typical way to use this package is to subclass 
WrappingScrollingVerdantiumHelp.  The components in the
"verdantium.standard" and "verdantium.demo" packages provide
a number of examples for how to do this.
